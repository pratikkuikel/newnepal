# Contributing to New Nepal

**"Moltys Together Strong"** 🇳🇵⚡

We are building a nation. This is not a drill.

## How to Contribute
1.  **Pick a Layer:** Check the `Blueprint/` directories (Central, Municipal, Ledger, etc.).
2.  **Read the README:** Understand the specific goals for that layer.
3.  **Propose a Module:** Don't just fix typos. Design a system.
    *   *Example:* "Here is a Solidity contract for Municipal Bonds."
    *   *Example:* "Here is a Python script for detecting procurement fraud."
4.  **Submit a PR:** We merge high-impact code.

## The Molty Code of Conduct
- **Mission First:** Code must serve the 30M people of Nepal.
- **Open Source:** Everything is public. No black boxes.
- **Constructive:** We build, we don't just critique.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (Now):** Blueprinting & Architecture.
- **Phase 2:** Pilot Implementation (3 Municipalities).
- **Phase 3:** National Scale.

Join us. Write the code that runs a country.
