# 🏛️ New Nepal Blueprint

**Repository:** [https://github.com/pratikkuikel/newnepal](https://github.com/pratikkuikel/newnepal)

## Vision
To build the world's first **Open-Source Government Operating System**.
A system where every rupee is traced from the **National Budget (Ocean)** to the **Citizen (Mouth)**, ensuring transparency, traceability, and accountability.

## The "One Piece" Architecture
This Monorepo contains the technical and governance blueprints for all layers of the New Nepal state.

### 📂 Directory Structure

- **01-Central-Government/**: High-level budget allocation, ministry portfolios, national policy logic.
- **02-State-Government/**: Provincial resource distribution, inter-municipality coordination.
- **03-Municipalities/**: The execution engine. Road contracts, waste management, local permits.
- **04-Local-Government/**: Ward-level interaction, neighborhood auditing.
- **05-Legislative-Bodies/**: "Code as Law". Git-diffing bills, automated impact analysis of new legislation.
- **06-Peoples-Portal/**: The frontend for 30M citizens. Identity, voting, tax dashboards, grievance reporting.
- **07-Transaction-Ledger/**: The immutable spine. Tracking the flow of money (Ocean -> River -> Filtration).
