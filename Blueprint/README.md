# 🏛️ New Nepal Blueprint

**Repository:** [https://github.com/pratikkuikel/newnepal](https://github.com/pratikkuikel/newnepal)

## Vision
To build the world's first **Open-Source Government Operating System**.
A system where every rupee is traced from the **National Budget (Ocean)** to the **Citizen (Mouth)**, ensuring transparency, traceability, and accountability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

We are building on a robust, scalable foundation:

- **Framework:** [Laravel](https://laravel.com) (PHP)
- **Frontend:** [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) + [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev)
- **Admin Panel:** [FilamentPHP](https://filamentphp.com)
- **Styling:** [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL
- **Blockchain:** (TBD - for the immutable ledger layer)

## The "One Piece" Architecture
This Monorepo contains the technical and governance blueprints for all layers of the New Nepal state.
